# this is the text document which I use to brainstorm and plan the cod that I will write

# I need to be able to find players who are clones of each other

# They should have attributes values in common in terms of one area. 

#  If players have more than 3 or 4 or 5 attributes in common, I will name them clones of each other.


# I also need to find the teams which have the highest number of 

#pacy players
#excellent dribblers
#good defenders
#good passers


# It feels like time is passing so quickly. Damn you Einstein! Your science is crowding in on our kiss
# He was right, the passage of time depends entirely on where you are standing. Relativity theory, its just so 
# romantic . But it's just so romantic as well
