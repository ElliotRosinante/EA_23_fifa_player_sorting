for the new plans , I want to generate a custom team. 
You have the chance to feed the function with the values you want for 
each attributes for each player in a specific position. so you can create your own custom random team

A game for two players. 
generate random players for one player
generate random playes for another player 
The player whose random team has the highest overall wins. 
This can be something sort of like a luck tester.

player who has the most players with the highest overall wins the game. 
criteria for winning. 
1. player who has players with the highest overall 
2. player whose total overall is the highest
